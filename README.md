# A-Level-Final-Project
For my final project in Computing during A-Level, I created a Quiz program in Python using TKinter and SQL aswell. The quiz focuses on A-level Electronics questions too.
Last checked to work with Python 3.6.2

Libraries used: TKinter and sqlite3

To Run the program, you need to download all the files here.
Run the "main_window.py" file from IDLE (don't double click it)
